# Introduction to GPIO and using seven segment :

In this project we assume that emergency centers have a control system for traffic lights that operates with 2 buttons:

- first button : changing traffic light's color from red to green.
- second button : stops the counter.

In this project we used :

- STM32F401RE
- 2 push-buttons
- seven segment mux-2 red
- red & green LEDs

(this project is implemented with CMSIS-Core)
